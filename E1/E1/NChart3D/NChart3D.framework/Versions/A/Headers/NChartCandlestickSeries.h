 * For example if you want to get a square candlestick, you should set resolution to 4. If you want to get a cylindrical
 * candlestick, you may set a larger value. But the larger is the resolution, the more memory is used and the slower the
 * rendering will be, so you should find out the minimal acceptable value. A good value for cylinder is 16 or 20.
 * The default value is 20.
 * @note This value cannot be less than 3 and greater than 32.
